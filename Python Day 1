# DAY -1 TEN  CODING QUESTIONS

#### 1. PRIME OR NOT

#Prime numbers are those which are divisible by 1 and itself.

num = int(input("Enter a number "))
if num>1: 
    for i in range(2,num+1):
        if num%i == 0:
            print(num , " is not Prime Number")
            break
        else:
            print(num , " is a Prime Number")
            break
            
else :
    print(num , " is not a Prime Number")
        

#### 2. FIBANOCCI SERIES

# where each number is sum of two preceding numbers.
num1 = 1
num2 = 2
series = int(input(" Enter a range for series "))
print(num1)
print(num2)
for i in range(series-2):
    sequence = num1 + num2
    num1 = num2
    num2 = sequence
    print(sequence)

 #### 3. FACTORIAL

# product of all numbers from 0 to the given number

fact=int(input("Enter a number for factorial: "))
fnum = 1
if fact == 0 :
    print(" Factorial of 0 is 1 ")
else:
    for i in range(1 ,fact+1):
        fnum = fnum*i
        
print("Factorial of " , fact , " is : " , fnum )

#### 4. EVEN OR ODD

# a number which can be divided by 2 is even number 
number = int(input("Enter a  number: "))
if number>0:
    if (number%2) == 0:
        print(number," is a Even number")
    else:
        print(number , " is Odd number ")
        

#### 5.REVERSE THE GIVEN NUMBER

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
reversed_num = 0
while number!=0:
    digit = number % 10
    reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
    number = number// 10
    
print("Reversed number is " , reversed_num)

#### 6. SWAP TWO NUMBERS WITH THIRD VARIABLE

num1= int(input("enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("enter second number: "))
print("Before swapping numbers are: " , num1 , num2)
swap = num1
num1 = num2 
num2 = swap
print(" After swapping numbers are: " , num1 , num2)

#### 7. SWAP TWO NUMBERS WITHOUT THIRD VARIABLE

num1= int(input("enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("enter second number: "))
print("Before swapping numbers are: " , num1 , num2)
num1 , num2 = num2 , num1
print(" After swapping numbers are: " , num1 , num2)

#### 8. FINDING PRIME FACTORS OF A NUMBER

import math

def primeFactors(n):
    while n % 2 == 0:
        print(2)
        n = n / 2

    for i in range(3,int(math.sqrt(n))+1,2):
        while n % i== 0:
            print(i)
            n = n / i

    if n > 2:
        print(n)

n = int(input("enter a number to find prime factors:"))
primeFactors(n)

####  9. MIN MAX FROM GIVEN 3 NUMBERS

a = int(input("Enter number1: "))
b = int(input("Enter number2: "))
c = int(input("Enter number3: "))
if (a >= b) and (a >= c):
    largest = a

elif (b >= a) and (b >= c):
    largest = b
else:
    largest = c

print(largest , " is the Largest number")


#### 10 CHECK THE GIVEN YEAR IS LEAP YEAR OR NOT

year=int(input("Enter year to be checked:"))
if(year%4==0 and year%100!=0 or year%400==0):
    print(year , " year is a leap year")
else:
    print(year , " year is not a leap year")

Done for the DAY !
